      These contain the tables loaded from the airbyte with raw data of the file that was generated for the day, the idea is to have
      truncate the table and upsert the data to the mart everyday. This uses the snowflakes own merge statement to do the upsert.
      Notes: 
          All the files have nulls in delivery date and category, either we need to add it based on the file type or exclude it. 
          The only needed field is the topcategoryname, so lets default it to the file name.
